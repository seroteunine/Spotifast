# Spotifast

Spotifast is a straight-forward Python script to download .mp3 files from a complete Spotify playlist in 320kbp/s.

## Installation

Clone this git repository. In addition, you also need to create Spotify developer credentials. This can easily be done if you have a regular Spotify account at https://developer.spotify.com/ Use these credentials in the python script.

## Usage

Change the ClientID, SecretKey and PlaylistURL in the main.py file and run it with python.

## Todo
-Easier user experience (GUI, no need for spotify developer credentials, choose download destination folder)
